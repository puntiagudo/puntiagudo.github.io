  a result of the assignment given by our teacher (kumu) E. Kalani Flores for
  the Hawaii Culture 231 course in Fall 2005 I was able to get more informed
  about the significant life of my grandfather as well to know more about
  myself, my name and the incredibly beautiful mystery of Life. I hope to pass
  on this information to my children and eventually complement it with data
  from my father as well as from my wife’s side of the family.</font><br>
